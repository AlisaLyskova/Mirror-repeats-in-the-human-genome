# Mirror repeats in the human genome
The main part of this work was written in jupyther notebook (file "MR_analysis.ipynb"). A detailed description is contained in the notebook. Repeats were found using written in C program (file "MR_purine.c"). 

There are also files with already found mirror repeats and purine segments ("data/MRpurine_HumanGenome.csv" and "data/AGsegments_HumanGenome.out" accordingly). 

Resulted files with repeats and features are "data/ouputs/MRpur_annotated.csv" for all purine mirror repeats and "data'outputs/MRpur_inAGsegm_annotated.csv" for mirror repeats in segmentes.
