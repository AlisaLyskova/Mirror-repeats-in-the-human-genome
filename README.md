# Mirror-repeats-in-the-human-genome
The main part of work was written in jupyther notebook. A detailed description is contained in the notebook. Repeats were found using written in C program (file "MR_purine.c"). There are also files with already found mirror repeats and purine segments ("data/MRpurine_HumanGenome.csv" and "data/AGsegments_HumanGenome.out" accordingly). Resulted files are "data/ouputs/MRpur_annotated.csv" and "data'outputs/MRpur_inAGsegm_annotated.csv".
